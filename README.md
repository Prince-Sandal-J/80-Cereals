**80_Cereals Dataset Analysis**

This project analyzes a dataset of cereals with the goal of understanding their nutritional values and characteristics. It explores relationships between various nutritional components and addresses any data quality issues.

**Project Structure**

The Jupyter Notebook is divided into the following sections:

**Introduction**

Brief overview of the dataset and the objectives of the analysis.

**Loading the Data**

The cereal data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and basic checks are performed, such as displaying the first few rows and checking the structure of the dataset.

**Data Cleaning**

This section includes steps taken to ensure the quality of the data:

**Handling missing or inconsistent values.**

**Replacing negative values** in specific columns like carbohydrates, sugars, and potassium with their absolute values.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Key statistics are calculated for each nutritional component:

**Summary statistics**: For calories, protein, fat, sodium, fiber, carbohydrates, sugars, potassium, vitamins, weight, cups per serving, and rating.
**Manufacturer breakdown**: Counts of cereals produced by each manufacturer.
**Visualization**: Any plots or charts generated to visualize the relationships between different nutritional values.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset consists of 77 different cereals with the following attributes:
name: Name of the cereal.
mfr: Manufacturer (K: Kellogg's, G: General Mills, P: Post, etc.).
type: Cold (C) or Hot (H) cereal.
calories: Calories per serving.
protein: Grams of protein per serving.
fat: Grams of fat per serving.
sodium: Milligrams of sodium per serving.
fiber: Grams of dietary fiber per serving.
carbo: Grams of complex carbohydrates per serving.
sugars: Grams of sugars per serving.
potass: Milligrams of potassium per serving.
vitamins: Percentage of FDA recommended vitamins per serving.
shelf: Display shelf (1, 2, or 3).
weight: Weight in ounces of one serving.
cups: Number of cups per serving.
rating: Consumer rating of the cereal.


**How to Use**

Clone or download the repository.
Ensure you have Python installed with the necessary packages such as pandas.
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

**Required Libraries**

**pandas**
**numpy**
**matplotlib** (For adding visualizations)
**seaborn** (For adding visualizations)
**Plotly** (For interactive visualizations)

**Running the Project**

Install the necessary libraries using the following command:
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Launch the Jupyter notebook:
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the 80_Cereals.ipynb file and run the cells in order.

**Results**

The analysis provides insights into the nutritional content of various cereals.
Negative values in certain columns (e.g., carbohydrates, sugars, potassium) were corrected by taking their absolute values.
Summary statistics give a clear picture of the range of values across different attributes, helping to identify trends such as the average amount of sugar or the typical calorie count in cereals.
